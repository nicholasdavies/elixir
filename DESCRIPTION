Description: Tools for transforming 'R' expressions. Provides functions for 
 finding, extracting, and replacing patterns in 'R' language objects, similarly 
 to how regular expressions can be used to find, extract, and replace patterns 
 in text. Also provides functions for generating code using specially-formatted 
 template files and for translating 'R' expressions into similar expressions in 
 other programming languages. The package may be helpful for advanced uses of 
 'R' expressions, such as developing domain-specific languages.
